My name is Hanie Safavi. I am 31 years old and from Madison, WI. I graduated from high school at the age of 16 from Oregon High School. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Degree from Edgewood College in Madison, WI. I worked with Hewlett Packard for two years. After working for two years, and while keeping my passion for education, I attended law school for one semester. While in law school, I decided it was not for me and that I wanted to pursue a different field. I went on to complete my Masters in Accounting Degree from Edgewood College in Madison, WI. After achieving my Masters Degree, I moved to Florida and worked for the Florida Department of Health for one year.  After working with the Florida Department of Health I moved to Wisconsin and opened a Virtual Reality Arcade in Madison, WI, which has been in operation the past 10 months. 


I am a very ambitious person. I have many hobbies including playing basketball, football, working out, boating, wakeboarding, hunting, hiking, traveling and many more. I am very active and energetic. Words that describe me include smart, funny, energetic, ambitious, calm and outgoing. I have a passion towards cars and motorcycles. I have traveled to over 8 countries in the past 10 years. In the future, I would like to set up one or two businesses of my own, while working as a software developer.
