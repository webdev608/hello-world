I am a very ambitious person. I have many hobbies including playing basketball, football, working out, boating, 
wakeboarding, hunting, hiking, traveling and many more. I am very active and energetic. Words that describe me 
include smart, funny, energetic, ambitious, calm and outgoing. I have a passion towards cars and motorcycles. 
I have traveled to over 8 countries in the past 10 years. In the future, I would like to set up one or two 
businesses of my own, while working as a software developer.
